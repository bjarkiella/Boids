BOIDS
=====

To run the game:
- Linux: Double-click 'run.sh' or run './run.sh' in terminal
- macOS: Double-click 'run.command'
- Windows: Double-click 'Boids.exe'

macOS Security Note:
  If you see "Apple could not verify" warnings, the app needs to be
  unquarantined. Either:
  
  Option A - Right-click 'run.command', select "Open", then click "Open"
             in the dialog. Repeat for any blocked .dylib files.
  
  Option B - Open Terminal in this folder and run: xattr -cr .
             This removes the quarantine flag from all files.
