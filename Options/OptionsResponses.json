    "The volume is already at peak performance. Any adjustment would upset the delicate acoustic balance we've spent millennia perfecting.",
    "Volume? VOLUME?! The current setting is scientifically proven to be 43% more optimal than whatever you were going to pick.",
    "We've consulted with the world's leading audio engineers, three hamsters, and a particularly wise oak tree. They all agree: this volume is perfect.",
    "I could let you change the volume, but then I'd have to fill out form 27B/6 in triplicate. Nobody wants that.",
    "The volume control is currently on holiday in the Bahamas. It sends its regards and asks that you stop bothering it."

    "This resolution has been blessed by the Resolution Monks of the Himalayan Temple. To change it would be sacrilege.",
    "We tried other resolutions once. The pixels went on strike. It wasn't pretty.",
    "The current resolution is exactly 2.718281828 times better than any other option. Trust the math.",
    "Your monitor has specifically requested this resolution. Who are we to argue with a monitor?",
    "Resolution adjustment is only available to Level 47 Pixel Wizards. You're currently a Level 2 Screen Squire."

    "The sound effects volume has achieved sentience and refuses to be adjusted.",
    "These SFX levels were calibrated by a team of extremely caffeinated sound designers at 3 AM. Pure perfection.",
    "We could change that, but it would require rebooting the space-time continuum. Bit of a hassle, really.",
    "The SFX slider is currently in witness protection. We cannot disclose its location or allow modifications.",
    "Fun fact: this SFX level was chosen by flipping a coin 47 times. You can't argue with that kind of methodology."
